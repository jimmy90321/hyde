Welcome to my blog. Iâ€™am junior java/android developer and live and work in Taipei(Taiwan), Using mostly the Java programming languages but i am exploring everything interesting(eg. Kotlin).
I want to use this blog to record my learning experience and share it with you!

This blog is made of a Jekyll-powered base on the Hyde theme. If there has any question and suggestion, feel free to communicate with me.
